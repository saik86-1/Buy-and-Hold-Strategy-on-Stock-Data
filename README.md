# 📈 Strategic Portfolio Optimization

## 🔍 Overview  
This project focuses on developing investment strategies using momentum trading and portfolio optimization techniques applied to stock market data. By leveraging historical price trends and risk-return analysis, it aims to create a balanced portfolio that maximizes returns while managing risk.

## ❓ Problem Statement  
Investors face the challenge of selecting optimal portfolios that provide the best trade-off between expected return and risk. This project addresses the need for a systematic approach to identify top-performing stocks using momentum trading and construct an optimized portfolio that surpasses traditional benchmarks like the S&P 500.

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset consists of historical stock price data from 30 S&P 500 companies, spanning the years 2017 to 2022. It includes daily closing prices, which are used for exploratory data analysis, momentum calculations, and portfolio optimization modeling.

## 💡 Key Findings  
- 📈 Momentum trading analysis identified the top-performing stocks consistently over the period, enabling refined strategy development.  
- ⚖️ An optimization model using Pyomo evaluated over 100 risk-return scenarios, successfully determining an efficient frontier for portfolio selection.  
- 💰 The final investment strategy, applied to a $100,000 portfolio, outperformed the S&P 500 benchmark by 34%, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining momentum trading with modern portfolio theory.
